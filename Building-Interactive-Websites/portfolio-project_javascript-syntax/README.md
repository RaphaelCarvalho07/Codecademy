# Random Message Generator

This project is a **message generator program** that outputs a new, randomized message every time it is run. The generated message is composed of at least three different pieces of data to ensure unique and interesting outputs. The program can take on different forms, such as:

- Astrology generator
- Inspirational messages
- Nonsensical jokes

Feel free to customize the program to suit your interests!

## Project Objectives

- Build a message generator program using JavaScript.
- Utilize Git for version control.
- Practice using the command line interface.
- Develop and test the project locally.

## Prerequisites

Before working on this project, you should be familiar with:

- **JavaScript**: Knowledge of variables, functions, and basic syntax.
- **Git and GitHub**: Understanding of version control and repository management.
- **Command Line**: Ability to navigate and execute commands in a terminal.

## Features

- Generates random messages every time the program is run.
- Combines **at least three pieces of data** to produce a unique output.
- Fully customizable for different types of messages (astrology, jokes, inspiration, etc.).

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
   cd random-message-generator
```

3. Run the program using Node.js:
```bash
   node messageGenerator.js
```
Each time the program is run, a new message will be displayed in the terminal.

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript: Core programming language for building the generator.
