# Project Task Board

## Overview

This project is part of the **Web Development Foundations** module, specifically from the chapter **Making a Website Responsive** under the topic **Learn CSS: Grid**.

In this project, you will create a board of to-do items organized into columns. All of the HTML and most of the CSS have been written for you, but the grid property declarations have yet to be added.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to practice and demonstrate your ability to:

- Lay out the structure of a grid’s rows and columns.
- Place items within that grid using CSS.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main files:
```zsh
root
├── index.html 
├── README.md
└─– resources
    └── styles
        └── css
            ├── reset.css
            └── style.css
```


## Instructions

1. Open the `index.html` file to review the HTML structure.
2. Open the `style.css` file to review the existing CSS styles.
3. Add the necessary CSS grid property declarations to `style.css` to layout the task board as required.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (including CSS Grid)
- JavaScript (for adding new tasks dynamically)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the initial layout.
4. Modify `style.css` to add the required grid properties.

## Adding New Tasks

The project includes a feature to add new tasks dynamically using JavaScript. To add a new task:

1. Enter the task description in the input field at the bottom of the task board.
2. Click the "Add" button to add the task to the board.

## Conclusion

By completing this project, you will gain practical experience in using CSS Grid to create responsive layouts. This is a fundamental skill in modern web development and will be valuable in building complex, responsive web applications.

Happy coding!
