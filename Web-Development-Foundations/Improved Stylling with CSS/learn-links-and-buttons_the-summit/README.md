# Improved Styling with CSS: The Summit

## Overview

Welcome to "The Summit" project, part of the "Improved Styling with CSS" module. In this module, we focus on best practices and implementations for demonstrating interaction and interactivity to your websiteâ€™s visitors.

## Learning Objectives

In this topic, we learn how to make links and buttons clearer in terms of their interactivity. By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand and apply best practices for interactive elements
- Implement visual feedback for clickable elements
- Enhance user experience through improved navigation design

## Project: The Summit

### Project Goal

The goal of this project is to improve the user experience of a ski lodge landing page. Currently, none of the clickable elements are very clear or offer good visual feedback to users. Your task is to use the knowledge gained from this module to enhance the interactivity and visual feedback of these elements.

### Instructions

1. **Analyze the current design:** Identify the clickable elements on the page and evaluate their clarity and feedback.
2. **Implement Improvements:** Use your CSS skills to improve the styling of links and buttons. Ensure that they are easily identifiable and provide clear visual feedback when interacted with.
3. **Be Creative:** While improving the interactivity, take the opportunity to be creative in your designs. Balance between slick styling and usability.

### Tips and Hints

- **Hover Effects:** Implement hover effects to indicate interactivity.
- **Active States:** Style active states to provide feedback when elements are clicked.
- **Focus States:** Ensure focus states are clear for accessibility purposes.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in your design for a cohesive user experience.
