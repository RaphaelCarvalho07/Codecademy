# Website Design System Project

This project aims to create an effective design system for a website, focusing on enhancing CSS styling. The goal is to develop a clear and reusable style guide that can be applied across various website pages to maintain visual consistency and improve user experience.

## Project Scope

The scope of this project includes defining a set of design standards, such as colors, typography, and UI (User Interface) components, which are documented and implemented in a way that facilitates the maintenance and scalability of the website's design.

### Colors

A section dedicated to colors has been created in the style guide, detailing the colors to be used on the website. Each color is accompanied by an optional description, explaining its intended use to ensure consistent application throughout the website.

#### Implementation

- **HTML**: We structured a section in the `index.html` file to display the colors with their respective descriptions.
- **CSS**: We styled the color panels in the `styles.css` file to visually present the colors attractively.

### Styling

The styling focuses on keeping the content organized and visually appealing. This includes:

- Defining a border around the color content to visually highlight it.
- Centering the color content to improve the page's aesthetics.
- Positioning the `h2` title in the top left corner of its parent element to maintain consistency with the overall layout of the style guide.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files:

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the style guide, including the color section.
- `styles.css`: Defines the styles applied to the style guide, including the formatting of the color panels and the general styling of the page.

## Conclusion

This website design system project represents a fundamental step in creating a robust and reusable style guide. By documenting and implementing consistent design standards, we facilitate the maintenance and scalability of the website's design, improving the overall user experience.
